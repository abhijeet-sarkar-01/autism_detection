# autism_detection

The main aim of this project is to utilize machine learning algorithms for the early identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder through the analysis of real-world datasets. This encompasses the design, implementation, and assessment of predictive models capable of categorizing individuals as either likely or unlikely to have ASD based on behavioural, demographic, or developmental characteristics. 

The project is directed by the following specific goals: 
* To gather and pre-process dependable ASD datasets that encompasses pertinent features such as age, gender, responses to screening questionnaires, and developmental history. 

* To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to comprehend the structure, distribution, and correlations within the data, which will guide feature selection and model development. 

* To train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, and to compare their effectiveness using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
